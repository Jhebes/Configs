# tmuxomatic session file ... Introduction / Description
####################################################################################################
#
# From Shell...
#
#   To run this session, call "tmuxomatic session_introduction"
#   For a list of tmuxomatic command line options: "tmuxomatic -h"
#   The filename ("session_introduction") doubles as the tmux session name
#   When tmuxomatic runs, it checks tmux to see if the session is active
#     If it exists, it attaches to the active session
#     Otherwise, it creates it from the session file
#
# File Format...
#
#   Comments start with '#'
#   Delimited by newlines (any type)
#   Blank lines are ignored except in the window definition block
#   Each window has a "window definition" followed by an optional "pane definition"
#     It is good practice to separate these by a newline, but it's usually not required
#
# Window Definition...
#
#   Begins with "window <NAME>", the name may include spaces
#   Ends on a blank line (recommended) or when pane definitions are detected
#   The window is comprised of pane identifiers designating where panes are placed
#   Panes must not overlap or leave gaps
#   Panes must offer a clean break layout, see "session_unsupported"
#   Pane identifiers are single characters that must match [0-9a-zA-Z]
#   Pane identifiers are used for cross-reference and not used as the tmux pane index
#   If no focus is specified, the first window has the default focus
#   The window and its constituent panes must be rectangular
#   The layout will be scaled to fit the user window
#   Multiple windows may be defined, each must be paired with its pane definitions
#
# Pane Definitions...
#
#   With the window defined, use a correlating pane id to configure the pane
#   Supported commands without a pane id (syntax: "COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]")
#     foc, specifies the window with the session focus (first window is default)
#     dir, specified default directory for all panes, e.g., "dir ~"
#   Supported commands with a pane id (syntax: "PANE COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]")
#     foc, specifies which pane will get the window focus (first pane is default)
#     dir, followed by a home directory, e.g., "1 dir ~"
#     run, followed by a command to execute (may be used multiple times per pane)
#
# Other Features...
#
#   For rapid layout modification, use the built-in window configuration scaling function

7777456					# All panes must be rectangular with no gaps or overlaps between panes
7777aaB					# Panes may be in any order, layout is proportionally fitted to user window
7777bAA					# There are 62 panes possible per window, using the characters [0-9a-zA-Z]
						# Blank lines are usually not required but may improve readability
dir ~					# Sets the default directory for all panes going forward
foc						# Sets the window focus for this session
1 dir /					# Sets the directory for pane '1' to "/"
1 foc 					# Sets the pane focus for this window
1 run ls -la			# Runs this command "ls -la" in pane '1'
a run pwd				# Pane definitions may be in any order
a run ls				# Multiple run commands are allowed, they are run in order they appear
a dir /etc				# The last directory specified for a pane is the one that will be used
2 dir /var/log			# Pane definition lines may be in any order
2 dir /var				# If the dir command is specified more than once, the latter most is used
